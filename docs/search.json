His Bachelor’s degree (also in political science) is from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. His dissertation is a historical, quantitative look at the Electoral College and its consequences.\nIn 2021, Jonathan served as the redistricting consultant for the Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission. He was appointed to that position by a vote of the commission. The final plan received a bi-partisan vote and was upheld unanimously by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. You can see these plans here. He served as Special Master for the state of New York in 2022 [Harkenrider v. Hochel (2022)] and drew the state’s 26 Congressional Districts and 63 state Senate districts. He has also served as the assistant to a federal court Special Master in drawing remedial maps in three redistricting cases involving minority rights. The first of these was Navajo Nation et al v. San Juan County,Utah in 2017; followed in 2018-19 by Bethune-Hill et al v. State Board of Election,which involved the redrawing of one quarter of the districts in Virginia’s legislative districts in the House Of Delegates; and in 2019-20, he worked on Wright v. Sumter County Board of Elections, a case involving school districts in a small Georgia County where former President Jimmy Carter makes his home. He has published several articles on both the elections and gerrymandering, and is a Research Associate at the Electoral Innovation Lab.\n\n\n\n",
